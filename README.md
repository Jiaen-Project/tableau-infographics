The objectives of this project are:
1. Apply data visualization techniques to describe business intelligence (visualize)
2. Perform appropriate statistical analysis using machine learning methods to explore, estimate, and predict on business applications (analyze)

The R project zip file consists of the R code of machine learning including the process of data collecting, data cleaning, feature engineering, predictive modelling, and best model selection.

After selecting the best predictive model with highest accuracy (lowest RMSE), the statistically significant predictors in the best model are used to create data visualization to illustrate the relationship between poverty and the predictors by using Tableau.

After that, a A3 size infographics are created to tell the story of how does the predictors (Corruption index, access to electricity, dependency ratio and GDP per capita) cause poverty by world region. The infographics is presented with insightful information and supported (cited) by research resource. Appropriate comparisons and positioning of the research significance from a wider perspective. 
The infograhics addresses the what's new, so what, and contribution of the story proficiently.

The project was graded High Distinction (22/25%) by lecturer and tutor.
